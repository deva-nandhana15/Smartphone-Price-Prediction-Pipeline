## 🎯 Overview

**Question**: Does this project use MapReduce?

**Answer**: **YES** - We use the **MapReduce programming paradigm** implemented through **Apache Spark**, which provides in-memory map and reduce operations instead of traditional Hadoop MapReduce Streaming.

---

## ✅ What We Used

### **Spark's MapReduce-Style Processing**

Our implementation uses Apache Spark's RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) API, which provides:

1. **Map Operations**: Transform data in parallel across cluster nodes
2. **Reduce Operations**: Aggregate results from distributed computations
3. **In-Memory Processing**: Keep intermediate data in RAM between iterations
4. **Distributed Computing**: Leverage multiple workers for parallel processing

### **Key File: `train_model_spark.py`**

```python
# This IS MapReduce - Spark implementation
train_rdd = train_df.rdd.map(lambda row: ...)     # MAP operation
gradients = train_rdd.map(compute_gradient)        # MAP operation
avg_gradient = gradients.reduce(sum_gradients)     # REDUCE operation
```

**Characteristics**:

- ✅ Distributed across Spark cluster
- ✅ Uses map and reduce transformations
- ✅ Implements MapReduce paradigm
- ✅ Industry-standard approach for ML at scale

## 🚀 Why Spark Over Traditional MapReduce?

### **Traditional Hadoop MapReduce Streaming**

```python
# mapper_train.py (NOT USED in our project)
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Read from stdin
    # Emit key-value pairs to stdout
    print(f"{key}\t{value}")

# reducer_train.py (NOT USED in our project)
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Read mapper output from stdin
    # Aggregate and write to stdout
    print(f"{result}")
```

**Problems with Traditional MapReduce for ML**:

1. ❌ **Disk I/O bottleneck**: Writes intermediate results to HDFS between iterations
2. ❌ **Slow for iterative algorithms**: Our 50-iteration gradient descent would be extremely slow
3. ❌ **Complex code**: Separate mapper.py and reducer.py files with stdin/stdout communication
4. ❌ **Job startup overhead**: Each iteration requires new MapReduce job submission
5. ❌ **Not designed for ML**: Built for batch processing, not iterative algorithms

### **Spark's Approach (What We Used)**

```python
# train_model_spark.py (USED in our project)
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Training").getOrCreate()
train_df = spark.read.parquet("/data/processed/train")
train_rdd = train_df.rdd  # Distributed dataset in memory

# Iterative training with in-memory processing
for iteration in range(50):
    # MAP: Compute gradients in parallel
    gradients = train_rdd.map(lambda row: compute_gradient(row, weights))

    # REDUCE: Aggregate gradients
    total_gradient = gradients.reduce(lambda a, b: sum_gradients(a, b))

    # UPDATE: Update weights (happens in driver)
    weights = update_weights(weights, total_gradient)
```

**Benefits of Spark for ML**:

1. ✅ **In-memory processing**: 50-100x faster than disk-based MapReduce
2. ✅ **Native Python API**: PySpark integrates seamlessly with Python ecosystem
3. ✅ **Iterative optimization**: Designed for ML algorithms that require multiple passes
4. ✅ **Simpler code**: Unified script instead of separate mapper/reducer files
5. ✅ **Better fault tolerance**: RDD lineage for automatic recomputation
6. ✅ **Industry standard**: Used by Netflix, Uber, Airbnb for production ML

## 🔍 MapReduce in Our Code

### **Evidence of MapReduce Pattern**

#### **1. Training Phase** (`train_model_spark.py`)

```python
def train_model(train_path, iterations=50, learning_rate=0.01):
    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
    train_df = spark.read.parquet(train_path)

    # Convert to RDD for MapReduce operations
    train_rdd = train_df.rdd.map(lambda row: (row['features'], row['price']))

    # Initialize weights
    weights = initialize_weights(num_features)

    # Iterative MapReduce
    for i in range(iterations):
        # ========== MAP PHASE ==========
        # Compute gradient for each data point in parallel
        gradients_rdd = train_rdd.map(
            lambda x: compute_gradient(x[0], x[1], weights)
        )

        # ========== REDUCE PHASE ==========
        # Aggregate all gradients
        total_gradient = gradients_rdd.reduce(
            lambda g1, g2: [a + b for a, b in zip(g1, g2)]
        )

        # Average gradient
        avg_gradient = [g / train_rdd.count() for g in total_gradient]

        # Update weights (happens in driver node)
        weights = [w - learning_rate * g for w, g in zip(weights, avg_gradient)]

    return weights
```

#### **2. Prediction Phase** (`generate_predictions.py`)

```python
def generate_predictions(test_path, model_path):
    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
    test_df = spark.read.parquet(test_path)

    # Load trained weights
    weights = load_model(model_path)

    # ========== MAP PHASE ==========
    # Predict price for each phone in parallel
    predictions_rdd = test_df.rdd.map(
        lambda row: {
            'item_id': row['item_id'],
            'actual_price': row['price'],
            'predicted_price': predict(row['features'], weights),
            'features': row['features']
        }
    )

    # Convert back to DataFrame
    predictions_df = spark.createDataFrame(predictions_rdd)

    return predictions_df
```

### **For Reports/Presentations**

#### **✅ Correct Statements**

1. "We implemented a distributed machine learning pipeline using the **MapReduce programming paradigm**."

2. "Our project uses **Apache Spark's RDD map and reduce operations** for distributed gradient descent."

3. "We chose Spark over traditional Hadoop MapReduce because it provides **in-memory processing**, which is **50-100x faster** for iterative ML algorithms."

4. "The training phase uses **map transformations** to compute gradients in parallel and **reduce operations** to aggregate results across the cluster."

5. "Our implementation follows the **MapReduce model**: map (parallel gradient computation) → shuffle (Spark handles) → reduce (gradient aggregation)."

#### **❌ Avoid Saying**

1. ❌ "We used Hadoop MapReduce Streaming"
2. ❌ "We wrote traditional mapper.py and reducer.py scripts"
3. ❌ "We used the `mapred` command for job submission"
4. ❌ "Our MapReduce jobs write to HDFS between iterations"

### **If Asked: "Why not traditional MapReduce?"**

**Sample Answer**:

> "Traditional Hadoop MapReduce writes intermediate results to disk (HDFS) between each map and reduce phase. For our gradient descent algorithm with 50 iterations, this would create significant I/O overhead. Each iteration would require:
>
> 1. Reading training data from HDFS
> 2. Running map phase (compute gradients)
> 3. Writing map output to HDFS
> 4. Running reduce phase (aggregate gradients)
> 5. Writing reduce output to HDFS
>
> Spark eliminates steps 3 and 5 by keeping data in memory (RAM) across iterations. This provides 50-100x speedup for iterative algorithms while maintaining the distributed computing benefits of MapReduce. Since modern production ML systems use Spark (Netflix, Uber, Airbnb), we chose it for both performance and industry relevance."

### **If Asked: "Is Spark MapReduce?"**

**Sample Answer**:

> "Spark is a **generalization of MapReduce**. It includes the MapReduce programming model (map and reduce operations) but extends it with additional capabilities like in-memory processing, SQL queries, graph processing, and machine learning libraries. Think of it as 'MapReduce++' - it does everything MapReduce does, plus much more, with better performance for iterative workloads."

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### **How Spark Implements MapReduce**

#### **1. RDD Transformations (Map Operations)**

```python
# Example: Extract features from each phone
phones_rdd = spark.read.parquet("/data/processed/train").rdd

# MAP: Transform each record
features_rdd = phones_rdd.map(lambda phone: {
    'screen_size': phone['screen_size'],
    'ram': phone['ram'],
    'storage': phone['storage'],
    'price': phone['price']
})

# This executes in parallel across Spark workers
# Each worker processes a partition of the data
```

**Under the hood**:

- Data partitioned across cluster nodes
- Each worker applies the map function to its partition
- Results stay in memory (not written to disk)

#### **2. RDD Actions (Reduce Operations)**

```python
# REDUCE: Sum all prices
total_price = features_rdd.map(lambda x: x['price']).reduce(lambda a, b: a + b)

# REDUCE: Count records
count = features_rdd.count()

# REDUCE: Average price
avg_price = total_price / count
```

**Under the hood**:

- Each worker reduces its local partition
- Results sent to driver for final aggregation
- Minimal network transfer (only aggregated results)

#### **3. Gradient Descent with MapReduce**

```python
def compute_gradient_for_sample(features, actual_price, weights):
    """Compute gradient for one training sample"""
    # Prediction
    predicted = sum(f * w for f, w in zip(features, weights))
    error = predicted - actual_price

    # Gradient
    gradient = [error * f for f in features]
    return gradient

# Training loop
for iteration in range(50):
    # MAP: Compute gradient for each sample in parallel
    gradients_rdd = train_rdd.map(
        lambda sample: compute_gradient_for_sample(
            sample['features'],
            sample['price'],
            weights
        )
    )

    # REDUCE: Sum all gradients
    total_gradient = gradients_rdd.reduce(
        lambda g1, g2: [a + b for a, b in zip(g1, g2)]
    )

    # Average and update
    n = train_rdd.count()
    avg_gradient = [g / n for g in total_gradient]
    weights = [w - learning_rate * g for w, g in zip(weights, avg_gradient)]
```

**Key Benefits**:

- Each worker processes its partition independently (MAP)
- Only gradient vectors sent to driver (REDUCE)
- No disk writes between iterations
- Weights updated in driver memory
- Next iteration reuses in-memory data
