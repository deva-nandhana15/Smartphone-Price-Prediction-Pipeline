## 🎯 Talking Points

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "We built an end-to-end big data pipeline that collected 89,000 smartphones from eBay, processed them with PySpark, and trained a price prediction model. Let me show you the interactive visualizations."

### Middle (8 minutes)

> "This dashboard shows 6 key performance indicators. Notice the training convergence - our model learned effectively, improving from $520 to $405 RMSE. Screen size is the dominant factor at 34.82 importance, followed by brand effects from Apple and Samsung."

### Closing (1.5 minutes)

> "While our model shows good training convergence and reasonable errors for mid-range phones, the negative R² indicates we need better features or a non-linear approach. Next steps: add processor info, temporal features, and try Random Forest or XGBoost."

## 🎬 Demo Script (30 seconds each)

### Demo 1: Interactive Dashboard

```
"Watch as I hover over this point... see the exact value?
Now let me zoom in... [click-drag]... and reset [double-click].
All charts are fully interactive!"
```

### Demo 2: 3D Rotation

```
"Here's our data in 3D. Storage on X, RAM on Y, Price on Z.
Let me rotate this... [drag slowly]... notice the price gradient?
Yellow means expensive, blue means affordable."
```

### Demo 3: Feature Importance

```
"These bars show which features matter most. Screen size at 34.82
is by far the strongest predictor - that's 1.5x more important
than brand effects from Apple or Samsung."
```
